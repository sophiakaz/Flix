# Project 2 - *Flix*

**Flix** is a movies app using the [The Movie Database API](http://docs.themoviedb.apiary.io/#).

Time spent: **17** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is complete:

- [x] User can view a list of movies currently playing in theaters from The Movie Database.
- [x] Poster images are loaded using the UIImageView category in the AFNetworking library.
- [x] User sees a loading state while waiting for the movies API.
- [x] User can pull to refresh the movie list.

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [ ] For the large poster, load the low resolution image first and then switch to the high resolution image when complete.
- [ ] Customize the selection effect of the cell.
- [x] Customize the navigation bar.
- [ ] Customize the UI.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Different ways to implement the search bar, and when to use each way.
2. Review use of network and API

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

I had trouble implementing the search bar. It isn't currently functioning, but I still included the code in this submission. When text is entered into the search bar, it crashes. I also struggled a little with the commit-pull-push protocol.
